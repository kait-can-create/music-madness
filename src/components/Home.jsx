        <p>Three of my favorite bands/musicians are those who have lasted through the ages. </p>

        <p>Nine Inch Nails: Nine Inch Nails was essentially a stage name for singer and multi-instrumentalist Trent Reznor. Nine Inch Nails began in Cleveland in 1988 while Reznor was working at a recording studio. He wrote, arranged, performed, and produced the majority of the material, bringing in other musicians for live performances. The band quickly gained popularity with its debut release, Pretty Hate Machine 1989, which eventually sold more than three million copies in the United States and signaled a breakthrough into the American mainstream for industrial music. </p>

        <p>The Crystal Method: Unwitting participants in the commercial rise of big beat, the Crystal Method broke through with "Keep Hope Alive" in 1995, a Top 15 U.S. club hit, and continued upward with Vegas in 1997, their platinum debut album. By distancing themselves from big beat and selecting collaborators from across a broad stylistic spectrum, they continued to thrive with studio albums such as Legion of Boom in 2004 and Divided by Night in 2009, both of which were nominated for dance/electronic Grammy awards. At the same time, they diversified with soundtracks for video games and films. Jordan eventually left the music industry, but Kirkland continued the Crystal Method as a solo act with The Trip Home in 2018.</p>
